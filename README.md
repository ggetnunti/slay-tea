Desktop Application Development Overview 
In this project, our objective is to develop a Windows Platform Desktop Application centered around the sale of tea beverages for employee use. The application simulates the operations of a tea drinks café named 'SLAY TEA', facilitating the process of receiving orders from customers. Employees are assigned the role of interacting with the on-screen interface, allowing them to edit, add, and delete items in accordance with customer orders. Once the order is finalized, the relevant information is stored in the database. Furthermore, the application provides employees with the ability to review order records, enabling them to track the number of orders sold each day. 

Development tools  
•	Visual Studio 2022: will be utilized to develop a Windows Platform Desktop Application with a graphical user interface (GUI) intended to run on the Windows platform. This application will incorporate various forms, including a login form, a main form (featuring the drink selection page), a confirmation form, and an order record form. 
•	SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): was employed to establish an SQL database integral to this project, housing two pivotal tables: 'tb_orderDetail' and 
'tb_userLogin'. The creation of this SQL database was facilitated through Microsoft Azure, adopting the Free - General Purpose - Serverless: Gen5, 2 vCores plan, with the designated server named 'np341.database.windows.net. 
 
Programming Language and Frameworks
